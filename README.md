# SublimeStorm

A Sublime Text keymap for PHPStorm. Inspired by [PHPstorm-SpacePeacock](https://www.github.com/ShawnMcCool/PHPStorm-SpacePeacock/)

##Latest release

[0.0.0](https://www.github.com/ehlovader/SublimeStorm/)

Still requires a build from source for now.

## Installation
### Settings import ( recommended )
- Download the jar from the releases.

- In PHPStorm, choose File -> Import Settings, and import the .jar file. (If you don't see the File menu, you may need to open a directory or a project first.)

- Install the plugin [ColorIDE](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7055?pr) to set the colors of the rest of the IDE.

> If you are using OSX then you need import `PHPStorm-SpacePeacock-osx-key-mappings.jar` after importing the main theme. This will fix your OSX specific keybindings.

## Font Rendering

The font used in the screenshot is Source Code Pro.

If you are using Linux then you may need to alter your bin/phpstorm.vmoptions (for 32-bit) or bin/phpstorm64.vmoptions (for 64-bit) to remove the useSystemAAFontSettings declaration and replace it with these three lines:

It's important that you back up your settings and compare the results both ways. In Ubuntu 13.10 these settings improved the display dramatically. In 14.04 these settings actually reduce the quality slightly.

    -Dswing.aatext=true
    -Dsun.java2d.xrender=true
    -Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=gasp

Use Oracle's Java 8 if you want the best font rendering on Linux possible. More info here: https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/entries/23455956-Selecting-the-JDK-version-the-IDE-will-run-under

## Key Maps

The key mapping has been updated to better fit Sublime Text conventions. Because I didn't think that `ctrl + shift + alt + t` is a reasonable key combination for something as frequently used as **Refactor This**.

Additionally, "search everywhere" HAD to be changed because double-tapping left-shift is a two stroke trigger. This is a problem because as you're working the IDE will be busy with analyzing, indexing, and all of the things that IDEs do. If it's busy when you try to hit the first left-shift, then the second left-shift won't pop up the window. As far as user interfaces go, you should never have any lack of confidence that an action will trigger the appropriate response. Once you have that, you have to visually check each operation which is slow and creates cognitive overhead. Consequently, this was changed to `ctrl + p` (also to match Sublime Text) which completely removes this problem.

`ctrl + p` search everywhere

`ctrl + r` search methods in current file

`ctrl + alt + p` change projects

`ctrl + shift + enter` complete current statement

`ctrl + alt + enter` refactor this

`alt + enter` show intended actions (intentions are one of my favorite part JetBrains software)

`ctrl + n` new thing dialog

`ctrl + shift + f` format code

`ctrl + d` select word at cursor, or if a word is selected the select the next occurrence of the word (multiple-cursors)

`ctrl + t` run tests

`ctrl + alt + h` show local history

`ctrl + alt + r` git conflict merge tool

There are others, as I think of them, I'll add them here.
